It also had the largest fishing fleet in England and one of the largest monasteries until King Henry burned it down in the 1600s (the church still remains and can be seen from your window).  It's currently undergoing a lot of redevelopment with plans for a nearby film studio, brand new shopping centre and a new station.  There are two gyms within walking distance, a multi screen cinema, three supermarkets and local shops.<br /><br />Historial Barking Abbey.<br />Barking Park<br />Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park<br />Westfield shopping centre<br />the 02<br />Emirates Air Line<br />Local gay scene in nearby Limehouse features a gay club, pub sauna!   \n",

We love this area for its diverse community where all ethnicities, social backgrounds and persuasions intermingle.  We've lived in the neighbourhood for 13 years and still love it.  In the past few years the area has gentrified further, which of course is not without its problems.  But from the perspective of a visitor you'll now find there are a huge range of independent shops, barista coffee spots and delicious food within a short walk either direction.  We'll leave a list of restaurant recommendations for you.   \n",

We are in Zone 2.<br />Kilburn has since the Roman times been a place a passage, Kilburn High Road being an old Roman road. It is multicultural and enjoys a very varied and busy high street, where as some say “everything and anything can be found”. Kilburn high road used to be the biggest shopping and entertainment street in Victorian times. We have shops  and eateries catering for all tastes, from the first Primark shop in London, to TKMaxx for example. The Tricycle, a very successful cinema/theatre, is minutes from the house. Kilburn is also home to the  “State”, now a church that was the biggest cinema in the world. It is opened to the public on Wednesdays. Within walking distance is a nice park if you enjoy a run and are travelling with children. If you like pubs, there are 5 within 5 mins walk. If you prefer a less busy atmosphere then West Hampstead and Queens Park are minutes away.   \n",

Depending on your preferences, you can find anything from gastro-pubs, farmers markets, hipster bars organic shops and cafes, to any of the many African, Bangladeshi, Turkish and other food shops and markets.  Peckham is full of creative people doing interesting stuff, heavily influenced by the proximity to the large Camberwell and Goldsmiths art schools.<br /><br />However, it's not all hectic! It can be a suprisingly relaxed and quiet place.<br /><br />The house itself  is between two large green spaces- the impressive Peckham Rye with  its green expanse, rose garden, ponds and cafe, and the lovely Nunhead cemetary with beautiful woods and amazing views over  central London  to St Pauls' Cathedral, the London Eye and beyond.   \n",
